AMBER documentation
=================================

Welcome to the documentation for AMBER, an automated machine learning framework to design deep learning models in biology.

The Github repository is `here <https://github.com/zj-zhang/AMBER>`_.

This Documentation is still much **Work-In-Progress**. As important as I understand how a good documentation is, being a postdoc researcher is not the best time to spend a week writing docstring. Thus, any contributions are greatly appreciated!

Feel free to contact me `here <https://zj-zhang.github.io>`_.
